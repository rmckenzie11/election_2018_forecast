My forecast for 2018 midterm elections. 

Democrats win House but lose Senate. 
State-wide, Republicans and Trump have been successful in making the election a referendum on immigration and the economy. In fact, Republicans will actually pick up a few seats, likely Heitkamp in ND and McCaskill in MO. The progressive campaign of O'Rourke will be unsuccessful, but centrists like Bredesen will also falter, leaving Democrats with no clear takeaway. Rep: 52, Dem 48.
In the House, Democrats will be effective in picking up dissatisfied Trump voters in suburban areas. In the Midwest and West in particular, Democrats will pick up seats, even seats they aren't favoured to win, like California 50 and Minnesota 8. Rep: 199, Dem: 236.
